# Fooocus-API

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/konieshadow/Fooocus-API/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/konieshadow/Fooocus-API/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

FastAPI powered API for [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus)

Currently loaded Fooocus version: 2.0.78'

### Run with Replicate
Now you can use Fooocus-API by Replicate, the model is in [konieshadow/fooocus-api](https://replicate.com/konieshadow/fooocus-api).

I believe this is the easiest way to generate image with Fooocus's power.

### Colab

Need python version >= 3.10
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 xformers
```
You may change the part "cu118" of extra-index-url to your local installed cuda driver version.

### Sync dependent and download models (Optional)
```
python main.py --sync-repo only
```
After run successful, you can see the terminal print where to put the model files for Fooocus.

Then you can put the model files to target directories manually, or let it auto downloads when start app.

It will also apply user_path_config.txt config file as Fooocus. See [Changing Model Path](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus#changing-model-path).

### Start app

For pragram arguments, see
```
python main.py -h
```

### Start with docker
Run
```
docker run --gpus=all -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -p 8888:8888 konieshadow/fooocus-api
```

For a more complex usage:
```
mkdir ~/repositories
mkdir -p ~/.cache/pip

docker run --gpus=all -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \
    -v ~/repositories:/app/repositories \
    -v ~/.cache/pip:/root/.cache/pip \
    -p 8888:8888 konieshadow/fooocus-api
```
It will persistent the dependent repositories and pip cache.
